Set `monthlyBudget` to your monthly cloud budget to enable budget vs actual tracking with 🟢/🟡/🔴 status indicators. The `tagKeyFilter` parameter drives the chargeback-by-tag tile on the Invoicing page.

### Cross-Filter Interactivity

The dashboard enables **cross-filtering** with column-to-parameter mappings on 17 key tiles:

## FOCUS Compatibility

This dashboard is designed to work with the [FinOps Open Cost and Usage Specification (FOCUS)](https://focus.finops.org/) schema. The table below shows compatibility with different FOCUS versions:

### Version Support Matrix

| FOCUS Version | Release Date | Status | Notes |
|---------------|--------------|--------|-------|
| 1.0-preview(v1) | Nov 2023 | ✅ Fully compatible | Initial preview spec |
| 1.0 | June 2024 | ✅ Fully compatible | **Microsoft exports this version** |
| 1.1 | Nov 2024 | ✅ Compatible | New: `CapacityReservationId`, `CommitmentDiscountQuantity` |
| 1.2 | June 2025 | ✅ Compatible | New: `InvoiceId`, `PricingCurrency`, `SubAccountType` |
| 1.3 | Dec 2025 | ⚠️ Works with deprecations | Deprecated: `ProviderName`, `PublisherName` |

### Column Usage Notes

This dashboard uses the following FOCUS columns that have deprecation notices in v1.3:

| Column | Dashboard Usage | FOCUS 1.3 Replacement | Migration Status |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| `ProviderName` | Commitment discount calculations, FOCUS page provider breakdown | `ServiceProviderName` | Defer until Microsoft exports 1.3 |
| `PublisherName` | SaaS page publisher counts and grouping | *(deprecated, no replacement)* | Defer until Microsoft exports 1.3 |

### Microsoft Extended Columns

The dashboard also uses Microsoft-specific extended columns (prefixed with `x_`):

| Column | Purpose | Stability |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `x_PublisherCategory` | Filter Marketplace/Vendor vs Microsoft charges | ✅ Stable |
| `x_SkuMeterName` | CPU architecture detection (AMD/Intel/Cobalt) | ✅ Stable |
| `x_SkuMeterCategory` | Azure Hybrid Benefit license type detection | ✅ Stable |
| `x_SkuMeterSubcategory` | Azure Hybrid Benefit license type detection | ✅ Stable |
| `x_ResourceGroupName` | Resource group grouping for unit economics | ✅ Stable |

### Forward Compatibility Strategy

1. **Current State**: Microsoft Cost Management exports FOCUS 1.0 schema
2. **Dashboard Approach**: Queries use FOCUS 1.0 columns for maximum compatibility
3. **Future Migration**: When Microsoft upgrades to FOCUS 1.2/1.3:
   - The FinOps Hub `Costs` function abstracts schema changes
   - Dashboard queries will be updated to use new column names
   - Backward compatibility will be maintained where possible

> 💡 **Best Practice**: Monitor the [FOCUS changelog](https://github.com/FinOps-Open-Cost-and-Usage-Spec/FOCUS_Spec/blob/working_draft/CHANGELOG.md) and [Microsoft FOCUS documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/automate/focus-dataset-columns) for schema updates.

- ~~**Experimental community items**: Add Sustainability, Workload Optimization, Maturity Scorecard~~ → ✅ Done: 3 new placeholders + Community Feature Requests card

### Future Enhancements

- **SKU-level breakdown**: Resource SKU and pricing tier analysis per provider — requires FOCUS `SkuId` / `SkuPriceId` columns (comparable to AWS Cost Explorer "Usage type" grouping and GCP "SKU" column)
- **Carbon & sustainability**: Carbon emission tracking per provider — blocked on FOCUS carbon columns in Azure export (comparable to GCP Carbon Footprint reports)
- **Multi-select parameters**: Upgrade subscription/region filters from single-select to multi-select with `in()` operator
- **Built-in time range picker**: Add ADX native `_startTime`/`_endTime` for ad-hoc date range selection
- **Multi-cloud tags**: Normalize tag formats across Azure, AWS, and GCP providers
- **Workload optimization**: Right-sizing and idle resource detection from Azure Advisor data ([#1602](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/issues/1602))
- **Predictive commitment models**: Forward-looking RI/SP savings projections ([#1060](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/issues/1060))
- **FinOps maturity scorecard**: Crawl/Walk/Run assessment with automated scoring
- **Cross-provider sub-allocation**: FOCUS 1.3 external usage driver attribution ([#1970](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/issues/1970))

## Dashboard Features

### Built-in ADX Best Practices

This dashboard follows Azure Data Explorer dashboard best practices:

| Feature | Value | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Auto-Refresh** | Enabled (15m default, 5m min) | Keeps data up-to-date automatically |
| **Base Queries** | 8 reusable queries | Consistent filtering with subscription/region awareness |
| **Parameters** | 8 configurable filters | Budget, tag key, date ranges, grouping, subscription, region, and provider filters |
| **Cross-Filters** | 19 tiles with column mappings | Click subscription, region, service, resource group, or provider to filter |
| **Drillthroughs** | 6 tiles with page navigation | Click to navigate from Summary/Anomaly/Rate Opt/Budgeting to Resource Drilldown |
| **Conditional Formatting** | 13 tiles with color rules | Budget status, KPIs, trends, and threshold highlights |
| **Human-Readable JSON** | Formatted with indentation | Easy to version control and diff |

### Batteries Included

All analytics capabilities are built directly into the dashboard:
- ✅ **Subscription & Region filters** - Interactive parameters to slice all cost data by subscription or region
- ✅ **Cloud provider filter** - ☁️ Provider dropdown to filter by Azure, AWS, GCP, or any FOCUS ProviderName
- ✅ **Cross-filter interactivity** - Click subscription, region, service, resource group, or provider charts to filter the dashboard
- ✅ **Drillthrough navigation** - Click through from Summary/Anomaly/Rate Opt/Budgeting to Resource Drilldown
- ✅ **Conditional formatting** - Color-coded KPIs, budget status, trend arrows, and threshold highlights
- ✅ **Multi-cloud analysis** - Provider breakdown, billing account hierarchy, and invoice issuer tracking using FOCUS columns
- ✅ **Cumulative cost tracking** - Running total comparison (this month vs last) for pacing analysis
- ✅ **Amortized vs Actual docs** - Built-in guidance on BilledCost vs EffectiveCost with ACM comparison tips
- ✅ **Cost forecasting** - 90-day projections via series_decompose_forecast with current month run rate
- ✅ **Unit economics** - Cost-per-resource, cost-per-subscription, cost-per-RG efficiency metrics
- ✅ **Budget tracking** - Budget vs actual with variance thresholds and 🟢/🟡/🔴 status
- ✅ **Chargeback & showback** - Tag-based chargeback and department-level showback summaries
- ✅ **CPU architecture** - AMD/Intel/Cobalt cost breakdown from SKU naming conventions
- ✅ **Data quality warnings** - Flags EffectiveCost > ListCost anomalies
- ✅ **SaaS tracking** - Full vendor/publisher/marketplace analysis
- ✅ **Spot analysis** - Preemptible instance usage and savings
- ✅ **Anomaly detection** - Rolling averages and spike detection
- ✅ **Rate optimization** - ESR, commitment utilization, savings breakdown
- ✅ **Azure Hybrid Benefit** - License coverage and optimization
- 🧪 **Tag allocation** - Tag coverage analysis and cost by tag key/value (experimental)
- 🧪 **Resource drilldown** - Resource-level cost under each subscription (experimental)
- 🧪 **MACC tracking** - Consumption commitment burn-down (experimental, manual setup)
- 🧪 **Provider comparison** - Side-by-side cost trends, service breakdown, and savings rate across cloud providers (experimental)

**Roadmap (not yet implemented):**
- 🔮 **SKU-level breakdown** - Resource SKU and pricing tier analysis per provider (requires FOCUS `SkuId` / `SkuPriceId` columns)
- 🔮 **Carbon & sustainability** - Carbon emission tracking per provider (blocked: waiting for FOCUS carbon columns in Azure export)

No separate query files needed - import the dashboard and everything works immediately.
