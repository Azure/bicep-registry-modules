# Contributing to Bicep public registry

> We only accept pull requests created by Microsoft employees for now. External customers can make proposals or report bugs by opening an [issue](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules/issues).

The following instructions are created to help with the development of Bicep public registry modules.

## Prerequisite

- Create a fork of the [Azure/bicep-registry-modules](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules) repository and clone the fork to your local machine.
- Install [.NET 6.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime)
- Install the [Bicep registry module](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Bicep.RegistryModuleTool/) tool by running:
  - `dotnet tool install --global Azure.Bicep.RegistryModuleTool`

> A GitHub Codespace is available which is preconfigured with all of these prerequisites.

## Creating a new module

### Making a proposal

Before creating a new module, you must fill out this [issue template](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Module+Proposal&template=module_proposal.yml&title=%5BModule+Proposal%5D%3A+) to make a proposal. Each module needs to have its own proposal. Please avoid including multiple modules in one issue. Once the proposal is approved, proceed with the following steps. You should not send out a pull request to add a module without an associated approval as the pull request will be rejected.

### Creating a directory for the new module

Add a new directory under the `modules` folder in your local bicep-registry-modules repository with the path in lowercase following the pattern `<ModuleGroup>/<ModuleName>`. Typical `<ModuleGroup>` names are Azure resource provider names without the `Microsoft.` prefix, but other names are also allowed as long as they make sense. `<ModuleName>` should be a singular noun or noun phrase. Child modules should be placed side by side with parent modules to maintain a flat file structure. For examples:

- `compute/vm-with-public-ip`
- `web/containerized-web-app`
- `web/containerized-web-app-config`

### Generating module files

> Before generating module files, please make sure both Bicep CLI and Bicep registry module tool installed on your machine are up-to-date. This is to avoid any file content outdated errors in the pull request validation CI, since the CI always uses the latest versions of Bicep CLI and Bicep registry module tool.

Open a terminal and navigate to the newly created folder. From there, run the following command to generate the required files for the Bicep public registry module:

```
brm generate
```

You should be able to see these files created in the module folder:
| File Name | Description |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `metadata.json` | An JSON file containing module metadata. You must edit the file to provide the metadata values. |
| `main.bicep` | An empty Bicep file that you need to update. This is the main module file. |
| `test/main.test.bicep` | A Bicep file to be deployed in the PR merge validation pipeline to test if `main.bicep` is deployable. You must add at least one test to the file. A module referencing `main.bicep` is considered a test. |
| `main.json` | The main ARM template file compiled from `main.bicep`. This is the artifact that will be published to the Bicep public registry. You should not modify the file. |
| `README.md` | The README file generated based on the contents of `metadata.json` and `main.bicep`. You need to update this file to add examples. |
| `version.json` | The module version file. It is used together with `main.json` to calculate the patch version number of the module. Every time `main.json` is changed, the patch version number gets bumped. The full version (`<ModuleMajorVersion>.<ModuleMinorVersion>.<ModulePatchVersion>`) will then be assigned to the module before it gets published to the Bicep public module registry. The process is handled by the module publishing CI automatically. You should not edit this file. |

### Authoring module files

The files that you need to edit are `metadata.json`, `main.bicep`, `test/main.test.bicep`, `README.md`, and `version.json`.

The `metadata.json` file contains metadata of the module including `name`, `description`, and `owner`. You must provide the values for them. Below is a sample metadata file with the constraints of each property commented:

```JSONC
{
  "$schema": "https://aka.ms/bicep-registry-module-metadata-schema#",
  // The name of the module (10 - 60 characters).
  "name": "Sample module",
  // The description of the module (10 - 1000 characters).
  "description": "Sample module description",
  // The owner of the module. Must be a GitHub username or a team under the Azure organization
  "owner": "sampleusername"
}

```

The `main.bicep` file is the public interface of the module. When authoring `main.bicep`, make sure to provide a description for each parameter and output. You are free to create other Bicep files inside the module folder and reference them as local modules in `main.bicep` if needed. You may also reference other registry modules to help build your module. If you do so, make sure to add them as external references with specific version numbers. You should not reference other registry modules through local file path, since they may get updated overtime.

The `test/main.test.bicep` file is the test file for `main.bicep`. It will be deployed to a test environment in the PR merge pipeline to make sure `main.bicep` is deployable. You must add at least one test to the file. To add a test, simply create a module referencing `main.bicep` and provide values for the required parameters. You may write multiple tests to ensure different paths of the module are covered. If any of the parameters are secrets, make sure to provide generated values instead of hard-coded ones. Below is an example showing how to use the combination of some string functions to construct a dynamic azure-compatible password for a virtual machine:

```bicep
@secure()
param vmPasswordSuffix string = uniqueString(newGuid())

var vmPassword = 'pwd#${vmPasswordSuffix}'

module testMain '../main.bicep' = {
  name: 'testMain'
  params: {
    vmUsername: 'testuser'
    vmPassword: vmPassword
  }
}
```

The `README.md` file is the documentation of the module. A large proportion of the file contents, such as the parameter and output tables, are generated based on the contents of other files. However, you must update the `Examples` section manually to provide examples of how the module can be used.

The `version.json` file defines the MAJOR and MINOR version number of the module. Update the value of the `â€œversion"` property to specify a version, e.g., `"1.0"`.

Once you are done editing the files, run `brm generate` again to refresh `main.json` and `README.md`.

## Nested Bicep Files

Nested bicep files should be placed into a folder `modules`, for example `modules/nested.bicep`.
Additional nested folders may be created, only if the nested directory contain multiple files.

Avoid the following:

- `./main.bicep`
- `./modules/storage/main.bicep`
- `./modules/compute/main.bicep`

Instead go with:

- `./main.bicep`
- `./modules/storage.bicep`
- `./modules/compute.bicep`

## Updating an existing module

To update an existing module, refer to the [Authoring module files](#authoring-module-files) section to update and regenerate the module files. Depending on the changes you make, you may need to bump the version in the `version.json` file.

### Bumping MAJOR version

You should bump the MAJOR version when you make breaking changes to the module. Anything that would violate the [Principle of least astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment) is considered a breaking change in the module. Below are some examples:

- Adding a new parameter with no default value
- Renaming a parameter
- Removing a parameter
- Changing the type of a parameter
- Changing the default value of a parameter
- Changing the constraints of a parameter, including:
  - Removing a value from the allowed values array
  - Changing a value in the allowed values array
  - Changing the minimum or maximum length of the parameter
  - Changing the minimum or maximum value of the parameter
  - Marking the parameter as secure
- Renaming an output
- Removing an output
- Change the type of an output
- Adding a new resource
- Removing a resource
- Bumping the MAJOR version of a referenced public registry module

### Bumping MINOR version

You should increase the MINOR version when you change the module in a backward-compatible manner, including the following scenarios:

- Adding a new parameter with a default value
- Adding a new output
- Adding a new value to the allowed value array of a parameter

### Bumping PATCH version

If your change is non-breaking but does not require updating the MINOR version, the PATCH version will be bumped by the CI automatically when publishing the module to the Bicep registry once your pull request is merged. The PATCH version is increased by the git commit "height" since last time the `main.json` or `metadata.json` file of a module was changed on the `main` branch. Because we only allow squash merging, the git commit height is always 1 for each module update PR merged into `main`. The following scenarios will trigger a PATCH version bump:

- Updating the metadata file
- Updating the description of a parameter
- Updating the description of an output
- Adding a variable
- Removing a variable
- Renaming a variable
- Bumping the API version of a resource
- Bumping the MINOR or PATCH version of a referenced public registry module

## Validating module files

> Before running the command, don't forget to run `generate` to ensure all files are up-to-date.

You may use the Bicep registry module tool to validate the contents of the registry module files. To do so, invoke the follow command from the module folder:

```
brm validate
```

## Running deployment tests

The `brm validate` command mentioned in the above step does not deploy the `test/main.test.bicep` file. Instead, it will be deployed to a temporary resource group as part of the pull request merge validation CI pipeline once you submit a pull request. However, due to security limitations, the CI pipeline won't deploy the test file if the module's target scope is `subscription`, `managementGroup`, or `tenant`. In such cases, you must run test deployments locally using Azure CLI or Azure Powershell before submitting a pull request.

## Submitting a pull request

Once the module files are validated locally, you can commit your changes and open a pull request. You must link the new module proposal in the pull request description if you are trying to add a new module. Adding or updating multiple modules is not supported and will cause a failure in the pull request validation CI, so please only add or change one module at a time.

### Optional: Enable Auto Generation with GitHub Actions

Enable optional GitHub Workflows in your fork to enable auto-generation of assets with our [GitHub Action](/.github/workflows/push-auto-generate.yml).
In order to trigger GitHub Actions after auto-generation, [add a GitHub PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) as a secret in your forked repository called `PAT`.
This `PAT` should NOT include the `workflow` scope.

## Publishing a module

Once your pull request is approved and merged to the `main` branch, a GitHub workflow will be triggered to publish the module to the Bicep registry automatically.
