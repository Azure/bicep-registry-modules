<h1 style="color: steelblue;">⚠️ Upcoming changes ⚠️</h1>

To provide our customers with a unified experience, Azure Verified Modules ([AVM](https://aka.ms/AVM)) will become the single Microsoft standard for Bicep modules, published to the Public Bicep Registry, via this repository.

Going forward, new modules will need to be developed and published in accordance with the [AVM specifications](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/specs/module-specs/). Module proposals for new, non-AVM modules will no longer be accepted. To propose a new AVM module, you can file a Module Proposal, [here](https://aka.ms/AVM/ModuleProposal).

Existing non-AVM modules will be retired or migrated to AVM. To provide continued access for existing customers, non-AVM modules formerly published in the registry will be kept there indefinitely, but their source code will be replaced with an informational notice and a pointer to their successor in AVM, when applicable. Over time, VS code intellisense support for the old, non-AVM modules will also be removed - while existing references will keep working.

The AVM core team will orchestrate this transition, starting with developing a migration/retirement plan together with the owners of the modules impacted.

For the list of available and planned AVM modules, please visit the [AVM Module Index](https://aka.ms/AVM/ModuleIndex) pages.
